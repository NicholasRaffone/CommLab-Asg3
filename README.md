Project Name: A Guy Who Talks for Hours

Project Description: 
A Guy Who Talks for Hours is an audio stand up comedy experience. The set up mimics a live audience at a speak easy comedy night. The story theme is dry sarcastic comedy built on seemingly mundane life experiences and the stories are a playful take on stand up comedy.
It is expected that members of the audience will have different reactions to jokes, hence, we have created a reaction sound board to engage our listener in the performance as is the norm at stand up comedy shows.
Each comedic performance immerses the audience in a different story and provides a foray into the performer's mind.

Process:

Audacity: addition of reverb, change pitch, eq curve, fade-in, fade out and merged several sound pieces.

Graphics: Gifs and PNGs produced with sketchers pro.

Reaction sounds: from freesounds.org and mixkit

Reflection/Evaluation: 

Our expectations were met. We were able to create a website similar to our wireframe and edit the sound recordings to communicate our messgae to the audience.
