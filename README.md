Project Name: A Guy Who Talks for Hours

Project Description: 
A Guy Who Talks for Hours is an audio stand up comedy experience. The set up mimics a live audience at a speak easy comedy night. The story theme is dry sarcastic comedy built on seemingly mundane life experiences and the stories are a playful take on stand up comedy.
It is expected that members of the audience will have different reactions to jokes, hence, we have created a reaction sound board to engage our listener in the performance as is the norm at stand up comedy shows.
Each comedic performance immerses the audience in a different story and provides a foray into the performer's mind.

Process:

Audacity: addition of reverb, change pitch, eq curve, fade-in, fade out and merged several sound pieces.

Graphics: Gifs and PNGs produced with sketchers pro.

Reaction sounds: from freesounds.org and mixkit

Web Development: We used vanilla JS to communicate between the HTML and audio. Using Toner.js, we were able to play and pause the audio clips dynamically. We were able to create abstractions of the buttons that allowed us to implement new audience and performer reactions seamlessly, and utilized event listeners to handle user input. 

Reflection/Evaluation: 

Our expectations were met. We were able to create a website similar to our wireframe and edit the sound recordings to communicate our messgae to the audience. If we were to continue with this website, we would look to increase interactivity, with the speaker reacting to the audience input in a more dynamic way. One idea we couldn't implement was where with enough booing, the comedian would give up mid performance.
